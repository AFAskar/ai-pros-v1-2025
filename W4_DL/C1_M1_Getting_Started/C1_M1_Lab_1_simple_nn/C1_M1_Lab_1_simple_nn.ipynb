This is a perfect example of how machine learning differs from traditional programming: instead of writing rules (like \"if distance > X, then time > Y\"), you'll give the model examples of inputs (distances) and outputs (delivery times), and it will learn the relationship for you."

    "* **Actual Data (orange points)**: Delivery times follow a more complex pattern. Bikes take short, direct routes. Cars deal with city traffic, then speed up on highways. The relationship between distance and time isn't smooth or consistent, it bends and shifts.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Model Predictions (green line)**: Your model can only draw a straight line. It learned one pattern: each mile adds about the same amount of time. But now that assumption no longer holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture these non-linear patterns, you need to give your model the ability to learn curves, not just lines. In the next lesson, you'll discover **activation functions**, a technique that transforms neural networks from fitting straight lines to fitting complex, real-world patterns. Activation functions allow neurons to learn non-linear relationships, enabling your models to handle the bends and shifts in real-world data."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've successfully built and trained your first PyTorch model to solve the initial delivery problem. You saw how a **linear model** could learn the relationship in simple bike-only data to make a correct, data-driven decision. However, the true lesson came when this model failed on a more complex dataset containing both bikes and cars. This revealed a key concept: a simple linear model, no matter how well-trained, can only learn straight-line patterns and struggles when reality becomes **non-linear**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge perfectly sets the stage for your next lesson, where you will learn how to give your models the ability to learn curves, not just lines. By working through the essential stages of the **Machine Learning Pipeline** in this lab, you have built a solid foundation. Understanding where and why this simple model fails is the crucial first step toward building more advanced networks capable of solving truly complex problems."
